# PROJECT: Secret message app

### Quik Intro :

This application allows users to encode and decode messages through URL manipulation. Users enter a message into an input field, which is then encoded into a URL string. This URL can be shared with others, who can paste it into the app to decode and view the original message. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js, this app handles message encoding and decoding efficiently, providing a straightforward interface for secure message sharing.
